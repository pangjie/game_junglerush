Jungle Rush is a "rock-paper-scissors like" game build with
[Andengine](http://www.andengine.org). The bite circle is modified to
elephant-cat-mice. In the game, targets will keep dropping from the top of the
screen, and the player have to click the right button on the bottom for biting
targets.


The UI style and sound effects can be exchanged in:
`./../JungleRushAlpha/app/src/main/assets`

Enjoy!
